# Java-String_To_Array
This Java program converts a user-input string into a character array. It reads the string using Scanner, initializes a char array of the same length, and fills it using a for loop with charAt(i). The array stores each character sequentially and is displayed using Arrays.toString(), efficiently transforming the string into an array.
